I have recently become a resident apprentice at 8th Light, after completing a student apprenticeship. The resident apprenticeship consists of a formal training program which equips you with the skills necessary to become a crafter, or software developer. If you were to tell me a year ago that this was the direction I was heading in, I wouldn’t have believed you. I had an idea in my head that programming was for a specific type of person, and that my lack of experience, social science educational background and level of intelligence meant that programming was not for me, and it wasn’t worth trying to learn.

My first experience with coding was a year ago when I started the Code First: Girls beginners course. It was attractive as it was advertised for complete beginners. The course went through the languages needed to build a website — HTML, CSS, JavaScript and how to manage your code via Github. Creating a website and seeing the instant visual effects after editing the HTML and CSS was fun, satisfying and more importantly, achievable. Maybe my initial impressions of programming were wrong?

I then had the opportunity to join 8th Light as a student apprentice full time. Would I enjoy coding as much if I was doing it full time? Learning a back end language is different to coding in HTML and CSS — would I find it too difficult? Is it too late to pursue a career in software development? I decided to give the student apprenticeship a go, leaving my job and learning Ruby full time.

During this time, I have found that there are 3 qualities that have helped, and will continue to help me during the apprenticeship — patience, persistence and passion.

Patience

Learning new technical concepts is tricky and it takes time to build up an understanding of them. Different people have different learning styles, and something that takes a few days for one person to accomplish, may take longer for another — that doesn’t mean you’re any less capable, it just means you need more patience to figure it out. I have learn to accept that I may not grasp things the first time and that by being patient and working hard, I will get there.

Persistence

As well as being patient, getting through those days where you come across something particularly difficult which leads to questioning your ability and concluding that maybe programming isn’t for you — persistence is key. I have spent many days thinking I have achieved very little as I have written no code or have nothing demonstrable, but actually I have spent that time reading, blogging or setting up a project. Those days are important and necessary as they provide the basis for you to progress.

Passion

When you have spent time working on an application, have managed to achieve something demonstrable that you are able to use (or watch others use), it is a great feeling. Listening to others talk about their projects and what they have achieved inspires and motivates me to continue to learn. I believe it is this passion and interest that has helped to be patient and persistent — all of which will aid in the inevitable hurdles that I will continue to face in the pursuit of becoming a developer.

My journey to learn how to program has highlighted that the short answer to the question above is no, it isn’t a necessity to have a computer science degree in order to pursue a career as a software developer. I have been fortunate to build on my coding knowledge in a supportive environment surrounded by developers and had mentors that provided guidance, advice and feedback that has allowed me to pursue programming further as an apprentice. If you have the patience, persistence and passion to learn, it is possible to learn new programming concepts and build your own applications — a non technical background shouldn’t hold you back in pursuing software development!
